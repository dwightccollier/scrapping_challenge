# scrapping_challenge
This challenge was fairly simple although I did initially struggle for a long time to get my program to recognize where my driver was and funnily enough after turning it off and on again that seemed to do the trick. I commented out my file path because I know it will not be useful to who ever gets around to grading this. All the files in the starter code have been adjusted to meet the requirements of the challenge
